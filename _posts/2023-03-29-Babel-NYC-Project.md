  <p>In my honors Sacred Texts class, we were given the assignment to express some aspect of the positive, 
  ambiguous, or negative dimensions of hospitality using the creative medium of our choice. I decided to create 
  a photo gallery website to combine my love of compter science with what I had learned in Sacred Texts. My goal was 
  to compare New York City to the city of Babel in Genesis 11 and show how language differences can foster community and 
  hospitality rather than disconnect. I really enjoyed having creative freedom for this project and getting to use 
  my programming skills even though this was not a computer science class!</p>
