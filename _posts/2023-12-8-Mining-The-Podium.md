  <p>For my Data Mining class this semester, our final project was to design and develop a research project implementing
  different data mining strategies we learned about throughout the semester and present our results in an IEEE standard
  research paper. My friends and I really enjoy watching Formula 1 together, so I decided to base my project on predicting
  Formula 1 race results. In this project I explored different data preprocessing techniques such as discretization and 
  binarization. For the model I implemented the classification methods of decision trees and random forest, as well 
  as regression. I created this project using Python Scikit Learn. I learned so much about data mining and Python while working 
  on this project, and now I can&apos;t wait for the next one!!</p>
