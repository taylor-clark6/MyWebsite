<h2>About Me!</h2>

<p>
Nice to meet you! My name is Taylor Clark, and I am a sophomore in the
<a href="https://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-lincoln-center/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/honors-program/">Lincoln Center Honors Program</a>
 at Fordham University. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in
French and Francophone Studies; I have a passion for languages of all types!
I am interested in programming and software development and would like to
pursue a career in Software Engineering.
</p>

<p>
I have experience coding in C++, Java, JavaScript, Swift, Python, and HTML, and I
have a JavaScript Level 1 Certification from CodeHS. I was also a Virtual Experience
Participant in the Goldman Sachs FinTech Engineering Virtual Experience Program as well
as the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Software Engineering Virtual Experience, both presented
by Forage. I also am proficient in using Git and GitHub, Figma, and the Agile approach to
software development.
</p>

<p>
I am a member of the Fordham University Computer Science Society, Google Student Developers
Club, and Girls Who Code College Loop. In Girls Who Code, we are currently developing a mindful 
food-journaling app, which we hope to complete this semester. It has been exhilarating
learning what goes into developing a functional app, as well as working with a passionate,
collaborative, and supportive group of women all dedicated to a profession in technology.
</p>

<p>
In addition, I am a member of the National Center for Women and Information Technology
(NCWIT), and I was awarded the Aspirations in Computing Connecticut Affiliate Award in 2021.
</p>

<p>
I am eager to expand my knowledge and experience in technology and software engineering! Please
do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:tclark38@fordham.edu">contact me</a> at any time with inquiries or requests!
